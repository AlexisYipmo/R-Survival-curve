Mosquitoes Longevity Analysis after exposure to bednets

Mosquitoes have been exposed to more than 02 bednets (Bednet1, Bednet2 and Bednet3) for 05 min. After exposure, we count daily death in each group : Control = group of non exposed mosquitoes Bedneti = Group of Mosquitoes exposed to Bedneti (i in 1 to 3)

We then want to know if there is a difference in term of survivability in each group, and what is the mean/median death death day in each group.
We also want to dispay the Kaplan meyer estimation of the survival curve for each group of bednet
